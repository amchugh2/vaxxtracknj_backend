# VaxxTrackNJ Backend
A free, open-source software that tracks vaccine availibility in Central New Jersey. Works by: 
- Checks multiple Monmouth and Ocean County vaccine website portals.
- Scans for any changes and for specific keywords that designate vaccine appointments are now availible.
- Checks if those keywords are new to the website (signifying a potential new opening).
- Sends email and/or SMS with update on potential vaccine.
- Updates community dashboard.
